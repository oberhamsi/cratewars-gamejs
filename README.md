Crate Wars
=============

small experiment with fullscreen & pointerlock; built with custom gamejs.org branch

Try: <http://apps.gamejs.org/cratewars/>

code info
==========

crosshair.js emulates a mouse, weapon.js keeps track of recoil forces.

the 3d implemented in scene.js and sprites.js is overpowered for when I wanted to make it parallax (it is, but looks crap so disabled).
